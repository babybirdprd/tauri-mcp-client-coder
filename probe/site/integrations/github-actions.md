# GitHub Actions Integration

Probe can be integrated into your GitHub workflow to automate responses to issues and pull requests, and even implement code changes, acting as an AI assistant powered by code context. This allows Probe to help answer questions, review code, or make modifications directly within GitHub.

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Issue & PR Assistant (Read-Only)

This example workflow demonstrates how to set up Probe to respond to commands in issue comments and newly opened pull requests or issues without modifying code.

**File:** `.github/workflows/probe-assistant.yml`

```yaml
name: AI Comment Handler

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened] # Trigger on new PRs
  issue_comment:
    types: [created] # Trigger on new issue comments
  issues:
    types: [opened] # Trigger on new issues

# Define permissions needed for the workflow
permissions:
  issues: write # To post comments on issues
  pull-requests: write # To post comments on PRs
  contents: read # To read repository code for context

jobs:
  trigger_probe_chat:
    # Use the reusable workflow from the main Probe repository
    uses: buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main
    # Pass required inputs
    with:
      # Define the command prefix to trigger the bot
      command_prefix: "/probe" # Or '/ai', '/ask', etc.
      # Optionally override the default npx command if the secret isn't set
      # default_probe_chat_command: 'node path/to/custom/script.js'
    # Pass necessary secrets to the reusable workflow
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      ANTHROPIC_API_URL: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_URL }}
      # GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically passed
```

#### How it Works (Read-Only Assistant)

1.  **Triggers**: The workflow runs when a new PR/issue is opened or a comment is made on an issue.
2.  **Permissions**: It requires `write` permissions for issues/PRs to post comments and `read` permission for `contents` to access repository code for analysis.
3.  **Reusable Workflow**: It utilizes `buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main`, which handles parsing the command, invoking the Probe AI agent, searching the codebase, generating a response, and posting it back as a comment.
4.  **Configuration**:
    *   `command_prefix`: Defines how users trigger the bot (e.g., `/probe <Your question>`).
    *   `secrets`: Requires AI provider secrets (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

### Example 2: AI Engineer (Code Editing Enabled)

This example demonstrates how to configure Probe to not only respond to comments but also potentially implement code changes using a specific AI persona (`engineer`) and enabling edit capabilities.

**File:** `.github/workflows/probe-engineer.yml`

```yaml
name: Probe Engineer Handler

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created] # Trigger only on issue comments

# Define permissions needed for the workflow
permissions:
  issues: write # To post comments
  pull-requests: write # To potentially create/comment on PRs (depending on implement tool behavior)
  contents: write # REQUIRED to allow code modifications

jobs:
  trigger_probe_implement:
    # Use the reusable workflow
    uses: buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main
    with:
      # Define the command prefix
      command_prefix: "/engineer" # Specific prefix for this persona
      # --- Enable Editing ---
      allow_edit: true # Explicitly allow code modifications
      # --- Set AI Persona ---
      prompt: engineer # Use the 'engineer' predefined prompt
    secrets:
      # AI Provider Secrets
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROBE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      ANTHROPIC_API_URL: ${{ secrets.PROBE_ANTHROPIC_URL }}
      # GitHub App Secrets (Potentially needed for more complex git operations)
      APP_ID: ${{ secrets.PROBE_APP_ID }}
      APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROBE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      # GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically passed
```

#### How it Works (AI Engineer)

1.  **Trigger**: This workflow specifically triggers on issue comments.
2.  **Permissions**: Crucially, it requires `contents: write` permission in addition to `issues: write` and potentially `pull-requests: write`. The `contents: write` permission is essential for allowing the workflow to modify files in the repository.
3.  **Reusable Workflow**: Still uses `buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main`.
4.  **Configuration**:
    *   `command_prefix`: Uses `/engineer` to invoke this specific workflow.
    *   `allow_edit: true`: This flag enables Probe's code editing capabilities (likely via the `implement` tool). **Use with caution.**
    *   `prompt: engineer`: Instructs the AI agent to use the specialized "engineer" persona, focusing on analysis and implementation.
    *   `secrets`: May require additional secrets like GitHub App credentials (`APP_ID`, `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) if the implementation involves creating commits or PRs under a specific App identity, depending on the underlying `implement` tool's behavior.

## Enabling Code Editing (`allow_edit: true`)

Setting the `allow_edit` input parameter to `true` in the reusable workflow (`buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main`) grants the Probe AI agent the capability to modify your codebase.

*   **Functionality**: When enabled, the agent gains access to the `implement` tool. This tool utilizes **Aider** (an external command-line AI coding assistant) under the hood to apply code changes based on the provided task description (e.g., "`/engineer Refactor function X`").
*   **Permissions**: Requires the workflow to have `contents: write` permission. Without this, Aider cannot modify files, and the `implement` tool will fail.
*   **Security**: Granting write access to an automated workflow, especially one driven by an AI using tools like Aider, carries inherent risks. Ensure you understand the capabilities and limitations of the AI agent and Aider. Review any changes made by the workflow carefully. Consider restricting this capability to specific triggers or branches if necessary.
*   **Output**: The exact mechanism of how changes are applied (e.g., direct commit, creating a PR) depends on Aider's configuration and the implementation within the reusable workflow.

## Manual Triggering (`workflow_dispatch`)

You can allow workflows using `probe.yml` to be triggered manually from the GitHub UI. This is useful for testing or running the agent on demand without needing an issue comment or PR event.

1.  **Add `workflow_dispatch` to Triggers**: Modify the `on:` section of your workflow file:

    ```yaml
    name: Manual Probe Run

    on:
      workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering
        # Optional: Define inputs for the manual run
        inputs:
          user_request:
            description: 'The request/question for Probe'
            required: true
            default: 'Explain the main function in src/main.rs'
          # Add other inputs if needed, e.g., target branch

      # Keep other triggers if needed
      issue_comment:
        types: [created]

    permissions:
      # ... your permissions ...
      contents: read # Or write if allow_edit is true

    jobs:
      trigger_probe_manual:
        uses: buger/probe/.github/workflows/probe.yml@main
        with:
          # Use the input from the manual trigger
          manual_input: ${{ github.event.inputs.user_request }}
          # Set other parameters as needed
          allow_edit: false # Example: disable editing for manual runs
          # command_prefix is not typically needed for workflow_dispatch
        secrets:
          # ... your secrets ...
    ```

2.  **Trigger from GitHub UI**:
    *   Go to your repository's "Actions" tab.
    *   Select the workflow (e.g., "Manual Probe Run") from the list on the left.
    *   Click the "Run workflow" dropdown button.
    *   If you defined inputs (like `user_request`), fill them in the form.
    *   Click the "Run workflow" button.

The reusable `probe.yml` workflow needs to be designed to handle the `manual_input` (or a similarly named input) when triggered via `workflow_dispatch`. Check the `probe.yml` documentation for specifics on how it handles manual inputs.

## Use Cases

*   **Ticket Answering Assistant**: Users ask questions (`/probe How does X work?`), and Probe analyzes code to answer.
*   **Pull Request Reviewer**: Invoke Probe (`/probe Review this change`) to get AI feedback on PRs.
*   **AI Code Implementation**: Request code changes (`/engineer Refactor this function`) and have Probe attempt to implement them (requires `allow_edit: true` and `contents: write`).

This integration streamlines development by bringing code-aware AI assistance and automation directly into your GitHub issues and pull requests.
